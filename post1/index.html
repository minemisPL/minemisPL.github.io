        This is an introduction to my first big project - <b>a blog!</b> <br>
    </p>
    But... made from scratch. <br>
    <br>
    I have no idea about webdev now, but I have (at best) a little of idea how to learn it. <br>
    So, the plan is to make this website great, with a lot of features and fun stuff, and show all the process. <br>

    <h2>Goals of the project</h2>
    <p style="text-indent:20px; font-size: large">Show all the process behind learning.</p>
    <p>
    Most of tutorials or courses give you only knowledge and sometimes some tasks, <br>
    but give you nothing about the process of learning, you need to figure it out by your own. <br>
    Here I want to show all the process and what's behind the hood.
    </p>

    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p style="text-indent:20px; font-size: large">Hello. I'm nobody</p>
    <p>
        My name is Mateusz Dąbrowski, born and living in Poland. I'm 17. <br>
        For now, I don't have any practical experience with webdev, and only a little in programming. <br>
        I'm still in the middle school, at a "programmer" profile where I will be for next 3 years. <br>
        Don't get fooled by the profile of the class, Dear reader, the school haven't taught me anything useful <br>
        since now, so I'm pretty sure it won't teach me until the end. So in webdev and programming I'm nobody yet!
