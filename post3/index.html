            I have a big project for my school to complete soon.<br>
            I will be a webapp for quizzes using react.js and<br>
            Spring Boot. So that's a lot to learn. I will make a post<br>
            about it as soon as I complete it. /*

        <h2>Today’s topic is JavaScript</h2>
        <p>
            Last time, I learned how to make pretty nice-looking websites using CSS. Check it here.
            But in the long term that’s boring. We need some effects, some explosions! Unfortunately, I have no idea how to make an explosion, but I made a few working buttons!
        </p>

        <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>
            For those of you who don’t know, JavaScript or JS for short is a programming language to do things in a website on the client’s side (it happens in your browser, even if you turn off the Internet connection). It can make some math, allows buttons to work, new elements to dynamically appear to your eyes, dear user.
        </p>

        <p>
            HTML and CSS on the other hand are NOT programming languages, even if they seem to be similar. They can only show you content, for every use the same and static. CSS allows you to make some animations, some dynamic actions, but still for everyone is the same.

        <h2>
            How have I learned (basic) JavaScript?
        </h2>

        <p>
            For past two weeks I was working for
            <a href="../project3/index.html" target="_blank">this project.</a>
             A simple (to use, not to make) to-do list web app using JS. Actually I made it in two days, but I had zero knowledge about JS before (except everything I already forgot from school), so I spent most of the time just learning basics.
        </p>

        <p>
            I used the best learning technique to learn stuff I know.
            As simple, as it is. Just type “[technology_name] tutorial” on YouTube and pick a few hours tutorial. It shows me how to use the technology, basic features and the most importantly what possibilities I have in this technology. A few hours course doesn’t teach me how to write in JavaScript for example, but it gives me knowledge what is in there, what are similarities and differences between the technology I learn now, and those I already know. I won’t remember all the rules, all the syntax, how to make an anonymous function, for example. But now I know there are anonymous functions and if I would need them, I know what to look for. I skip some things if I already know them or they seem obvious to me. But when I notice something, what I don’t know (like anonymous functions, which I haven’t seen before) I write an example with it myself to make sure I understand how it works and where I may need to use it.
        </p>

        <p>
            That’s only the first step.
            I used
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9dEgHpCNJE">this course</a>
             from already known Bro Code channel. Brofist for him! And
            <a target="_blank" href="./exercise/exercise.html">here</a>
             are my “notes” from it. (I don’t like to make many notes).
            Usually at this point I start to make a project in that technology. (You learn the best by practice!), but this time I chose to learn some clean code and project structure first. Some examples of good and bad code. I already have written a few small projects in Java (Minecraft server plugins and tiny android apps) so I know some project structure in Java.
        </p>

        <p>
            But JavaScript surprisingly is nothing alike with Java. Those languages are fundamentally different. I watched some tutorial about clean code in JS,
            <br>

            <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            But I haven’t found much about project structure. I came with something similar to Java by myself, and I think it works just fine for now.
            With all the knowledge I had, I started to search an idea for the project. I found a tutorial for a beginner level project for JS, the to-do list. It seemed great for the first project!
            Maybe even too great, because the tutorial was very beginner level. But not with the teaching, but with the code quality, which was quite poor I think, without any clean code rules. I decided to improve it by myself, what just ended with make the whole app by myself from scratch. I found in the process how many bugs were in the code that needed to be fixed. However, I am really thankful for the author of the tutorial, because he gave me a great opportunity to learn and improve myself.

            To view the source code of my app, go to my GitHub page:
            <a href="https://github.com/minemisPL" target="_blank">https://github.com/minemisPL</a>

        </p>

        <p>
            When I write it, I think my next project will be to make a tool for showing the source code of my apps nicely directly on the page. Also, some kind of project tracker, when I will write all of my projects and show on what I’m working on, plans and already completed stuff. I’m getting excited!
